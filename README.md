# ~/.config

Everything terminal configuration related is contained within the `~/.config` dir; keeps things nice and organized
- With the exception of the `~/.ssh/config`

This repo would not have been possible without GNU Stow. Thank you [Adrian Garcia](https://github.com/AdrianG0954) for putting me on!
