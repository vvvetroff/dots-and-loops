# vvvetroff's (cax) config files

I try to put everything relevant to the terminal/shell experience within the .config dir.
That way, I do not have to consult ".tmux.conf" file or the ".zshrc" file then go to "~/.config/nvim".
Keeps things organized and in one place.
- With the exception of the .gitconfig file

This repo would not have been possible without GNU Stow.
Thank you Adrian Garcia for putting me on!
